Represents the percentage trends of each outcome based on the dollar amount ranges in Goals for all projects.

The data suggests that the play's depends of the date of the campaign launch, the funding goal and the size of the budget.

## Results

Theater Outcome by Launch Date

The data represents the rate of each campaign outcome based on the launch date for only theater campaigns. 
Overall demand increases from Feb to August. The highest volume of successful campaigns were launched in May, while the lowest volume of successful campaigns were launched in December. 

Outcomes based on Goals

The highest successful rate has a budget goal "less than 1000" (76%) and the next successful rate has a budget goal between "1000 to 4999"(73%)
100% Failed in the range of "45000 to 44900".

In summary, the play 'Fever" is most likely to succeed if additional data has been analyzed before launching for example if there is a relationship between the success and the duration of the campaign.
